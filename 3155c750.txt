- Good modular structure of the files
- Obstruction-implementation
- Elevator.go - Default cases in the Switch instances will never do anything and are redundant
- Language could be more mature
- Recursive TCP call. Use a for-loop instead, and put a "continue" in the error-handling. Infinite recursive calls might lead to stack overflow.
- Listen_recive[sic!] and Decode: A function that exists only to call another function in a for-loop seems redundant, especially when it's the only place the other function is called.
There are a couple of issues with the code itself, listed in the bullet points above. Current implementation of the obstruction seems at a glance to be too simple. Though without having tried it, it seems to currently just make the elevator pass a floor if it is engaged while the elevator is moving. Won't it send the elevator out of bounds?
The comments in general need a pass to make it more professionial. Beginning a comment with "basically justâ€¦" and ending comments with "i think" reeks of uncertainty and unprofessionalism. Make sure the language is correct, also in terms of capital letters and punctuation. Self explanatory functions don't need commenting.
