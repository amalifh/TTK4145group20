1. Good overall structure, modularized well.
2. Having everything in the folder called "network" is counterintuitive, should be taken out.
3. Main is structured and clearly sets up the components and can clearly tell the communication. 
4. Huge sections of code commented out some places, should be removed if not used.
5. fsm.go: setting on all of the lights? Is commented on so know the group is aware
6. Inconsistency with comments on English and Norwegian, should be all in English. 

Overall, the project demonstrates a solid grasp of concurrent programming in Go and a clear peer-to-peer design with master/slave coordination. With some refinements in structure (e.g. reducing global state and enhancing error management) and consistent documentation, the codebase should remain maintainable as the project scales.
