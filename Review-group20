The project demonstrates a well-organized modular structure, with clear separation between hardware drivers, control logic, and request assignment.

The main entry points (in elevatorMain.go and main.go) effectively initialize channels, timers, and network components, facilitating smooth event handling.

Concurrency is handled efficiently through channels and goroutines, though the heavy use of panic for error handling could be refined for improved robustness.

The broadcast and peer discovery mechanisms are robust and well-commented, despite the inherent complexity of using reflection for type-tagged JSON messaging.

Type definitions and constants are consistently used across the modules, aiding readability and maintainability.

Global state usage in the elevator controller (e.g., CurrentElevator) is clear, but further encapsulation could enhance testability.

Overall, the code is readable and scalable, meeting the project requirements, with minor improvements needed in error management and state encapsulation
