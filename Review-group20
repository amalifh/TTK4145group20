- The main entry point (main.go) effectively initializes components and clearly demonstrates the modular design of the system.
- Concurrency is well-managed in request_main.go with multiple channels and goroutines coordinating button events, peer updates, and periodic status broadcasts.
- The broadcast module (bcast.go and bcast_conn_windows.go) uses an advanced reflection-based approach; its detailed comments help mitigate the inherent complexity.
- Helper functions in request_utilities.go and the assignment logic in hall_request_assigner.go and request_assigner.go show a clear separation of concerns and robust request handling.
- Peer discovery via the peers.go module is implemented with appropriate timeouts and update mechanisms, enhancing network reliability.
- Some error handling relies on panics, which, while acceptable in a hardware-interfacing context, could be improved with more graceful recovery strategies.
- Overall, the codebase is modular, well-commented, and maintainable, though its complexity may require careful documentation for future scalability.

- The elevatorMain.go file serves as a clear entry point, setting up event channels and custom timers to handle hardware inputs and elevator state changes.
- The elevatorController module centralizes control logic and state management (via CurrentElevator) and provides a straightforward mechanism for processing events like button presses, floor arrivals, and timeouts.
- Separation between hardware interaction (elevator_io.go) and control logic enhances clarity, even though reliance on a global state variable (CurrentElevator) could be further encapsulated.
- Type definitions in elevatorTypes.go, hardwareType.go, and requestType.go contribute to a well-organized code structure that aids in readability.
- The use of timers and event loops in elevatorMain.go is clear and effective for managing door and mobility events.
- Comments throughout the code are helpful, though occasional more concise documentation could improve overall clarity.
- In summary, the project is organized and maintainable, with well-defined modules and clear data flow; minor improvements in state encapsulation and error handling could further enhance the design.
