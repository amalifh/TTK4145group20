1. Good overall structure, modulized well.
2. Having everything in the folder called "network" is not intuitive, should be taken out.
3. Main is structured and clearly sets up the components and can clearly tell the communication. 
4. Huge sections of code commented out some places, should be removed if not used.
5. fsm.go: setting on all of the lights? Is commented on so know the group is aware
6. Inconsistency with comments on English and Norwegian, should be all in English.
